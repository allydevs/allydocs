## Advantages of Open-Source

Ally is open source, so you can see exactly what needs to be done, and request
features to be added!  Or, you could contribute them yourself by adding to the
code.

### Issues

By creating issues, you can track bugs and request features to be added, so
your server will be customized to your heart's content.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are like asking to add your code to what is served to users
through the bot, so you can contribute the things you want and have them
released to other users.  Contributing also helps out the team, by lessening
the load for them.
